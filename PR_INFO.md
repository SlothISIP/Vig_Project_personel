## PR Title
Update Project Documentation with Honest Assessment

## Summary

This PR updates the project documentation to provide an honest and realistic assessment of the current state:

### Changes Made

1. **README.md Updated**
   - Changed from "Production-Ready" to "Framework"
   - Added "What This Project Is" vs "What This Project Is NOT (Yet)" sections
   - Documented honest 60-70% completion status
   - Clear disclaimers about missing ML models and datasets
   - Performance claims marked as "requires validation"

2. **test_verification.txt Added**
   - Workflow verification file
   - Documents git operations status
   - Confirms project completion metrics

### Why This Change?

The previous documentation contained exaggerated claims:
- ❌ "Production-Ready" without trained models
- ❌ "95%+ accuracy" without model files to validate
- ❌ "100-150x improvements" without benchmarks

### What's Actually Complete?

**Software Engineering** (90%+):
- ✅ API Server with FastAPI
- ✅ Digital Twin Simulation
- ✅ Production Scheduling (CP-SAT + RL framework)
- ✅ React Frontend with 3D Visualization
- ✅ E2E Testing Suite
- ✅ Docker & Kubernetes Configuration
- ✅ Comprehensive Documentation

**AI/ML Components** (0%):
- ❌ No trained Vision AI models
- ❌ No trained Predictive Maintenance models
- ❌ No trained RL policies
- ❌ No datasets included

### Overall Assessment

**Honest Completion**: 60-70%
- Excellent software architecture and integration
- Complete framework ready for ML training
- Missing the AI/ML components that make it "production-ready"

### Best Use Cases

- ✅ Software engineering portfolio
- ✅ System architecture reference
- ✅ Integration patterns study
- ✅ Academic/learning purposes
- ❌ Direct production deployment (requires ML training first)

## Test Plan
